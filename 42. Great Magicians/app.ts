// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 41. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

let Magicians: string[] = [ "Herry Poter" , "Teller" , "David Blaine" , "Criss Angel" ]
function make_great(Magicians:string[]){
for(let i =0; i<Magicians.length; i++){
    Magicians[i] = Magicians[i] + ` the Great`;
}
}
function show_magicians(magicians: string[]): void {
    for (let magician of magicians) {
        console.log(magician);
    }
}
make_great(Magicians);
show_magicians(Magicians);
